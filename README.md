# react-native-content-swiper

React Native Content Swiper is simple "plain JS" image viewer component for your
RN/Expo app that includes multiple pre-defined animations, but you can easily make
your own.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-content-swiper
```

Or

```sh
npm install react-native-content-swiper
```

## NOTE

This is still in development, so you can expect some changes in few days/weeks, but I'm
happy if you already try it.
